<h1>Shantilal: An Ideal Student</h1>
<p>Shantilal possessed the ornaments of both spirituality and studies. He was a brilliant student, coming top or second in his class; even in daily attendance!
He diligently revised his daily lessons at home on the same day, often studying with Chunilal until 1.30 am. During exams, he thoroughly prepared and hence had no fear. Shantilal would chant ‘Swaminarayan’. His impeccable behaviour, quiet, disciplined and orderly nature inspired his peers. As a child, young Shantilal excelled in his studies. When he began studying in Padra, a village 6 km from Chansad, he would insist on getting there early. His childhood friend, Ambalalbhai, recalls, “I used to be lazy, but Shantilal would always insist that we left on time. We would both take a long time in cycling but when it came to hills I would stop cycling and let Shantilal pull me uphill. He would happily cycle away without a single complaint.”<p>
